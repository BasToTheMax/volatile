## Background

This used to be a public key-value pair API service located at https://volatile.wtf, but it was closed in April 2020 due to abuse. The code is now open source for those who would like to run their own version of the service.

## Resources

* [engine.php](https://github.com/neatnik/volatile/blob/master/engine.php) is the main code
* [volatile.sql](https://github.com/neatnik/volatile/blob/master/volatile.sql) is the database schema
